# Time tags transform program
It's a mex function to transform the original time tags to the startstop form.
In the Quantum Key Distribution experiments, we use signle photon detectors to detect the arriving photons. Then, a time-to-digital converter will record the arriving time of these photons. Swabian time tagger use 64-bit integer numbers to specifie time in picoseconds. Timetags indicate time since device start-up and a cycle period is about 107 days. 
In most QKD experiments, we use an additional siginal with finxed-frequency to sync all QKD system. We want to know the time between the arriving photons and the last synchronizing siginal. Therefor, we need to transform the original timestamps to startstop form. In addition, the real time post-processing system need to process the current cycle arriving timestamps before next cycle's timestamps arriving. 
The first edition of transform programe is written using Matlab, it can handle 100M timestamps per second in BB84 protocal. However, this processing speed is too low to hanndle MDI-QKD protocal. Thus, I use C to reconstruct codes and packaging them in MEX file functions. Then, it can be called in Matlab and have a 240M timestamps per second processing speed.
