# Time tags transform code
It's a Mex function to transform the original time tags to the start-stop form.
In the Quantum Key Distribution experiments, we use single-photon detectors to detect the arriving photons. Then, a time-to-digital converter will record the arrival time of these photons. Swabian time-tagger uses 64-bit integer numbers to specify the time in picoseconds. Timetags indicate the time since the device start-up and a cycle period is about 107 days. 
In most QKD experiments, we use an additional signal with a fixed frequency to sync all QKD systems. We want to know the time between the arriving photons and the last synchronizing signal. Therefore, we need to transform the original timestamps to start-stop form. In addition, the real-time post-processing system needs to process the current cycle arriving timestamps before the next cycle's timestamps arrive. 
The first edition of the transformation program is written using Matlab, it can handle 97M timestamps per second in BB84 protocol. However, this processing speed is too low to handle the MDI-QKD protocol. Thus, I use C to reconstruct codes and package them in MEX file functions. Then, it can be called in Matlab and have 270M timestamps per second processing speed.
